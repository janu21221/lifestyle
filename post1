"Style" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, taken from her fifth studio album, 1989 (2014). The song was written by Swift and with its producers Max Martin, Shellback, and Ali Payami. "Style" was released to radio stations as the album's third single on February 9, 2015, by Republic Records in partnership with Big Machine. Musically, the song incorporates funk-pop, pop rock and synth-pop, featuring heavy synthesizers, vocal reverberation, and a disco-tinged groove. The lyrics are about an unhealthy relationship from which a couple could not escape, because they are never "out of style".

The song received positive reviews from critics, many of whom deemed it the album's highlight. The song was nominated for International Work of the Year at the APRA Music Awards, and appeared on year-end lists by Pitchfork (2014) and Pazz & Jop (2015). In the US, "Style" peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming 1989's third consecutive Hot 100 top-ten single. It was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). "Style" also entered the top ten on charts and received multi-platinum certifications in Australia and Canada. It was the third bestselling adult contemporary song of 2015 in the US.

Filmmaker Kyle Newman directed the song's music video featuring actor Dominic Sherwood as Swift's love interest. Premiering on February 13, 2015, the video featured a darker and more abstract atmosphere compared to those for previous 1989 singles "Shake It Off" and "Blank Space". Swift included "Style" on regular set lists for two of her world tours: the 1989 World Tour (2015) and the Reputation Stadium Tour (2018).

Production and release
Inspired by pop music of the 1980s and its experimentation with synthesizers, drum pads, and overlapped vocals, Taylor Swift decided to move away from the signature country styles of her previous releases and incorporate a straightforward pop production for her fifth studio album, 1989.[1][2][3] The recording process began in mid-2013 concurrently with the start of Swift's headlining world tour in support of her fourth studio album Red.[4] Swift announced in February 2014 that she was working again with Max Martin and Shellback, with whom she had collaborated on three songs for Red.[5] The two produced seven of the thirteen tracks for the album's standard edition; Martin also served as executive producer with Swift.[6]

"Style" was originally written by producer Ali Payami and guitarist Niklas Ljungfelt for themselves. The two finished the instrumental â€“ a guitar-driven track inspired by what Ljungfelt called "funky electronic music" artists such as Daft Punk. Payami played the instrumental for Martin at the latter's studio; Swift became fond of the track after overhearing it and decided to record it for her album.[2] Swift, Payami, Martin, and Shellback are credited as the song's writers. Production was handled by all the songwriters except Swift. Michael Illbert and Sam Holland recorded the track at MXM Studios in Stockholm and Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with assistance from Cory Bice. The song was mixed by Serban Ghenea and John Hanes at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City.[6] "Style" was one of the last songs finished by the production team for 1989.[7]

The song debuted as a snippet in a Target commercial for the album on October 22, 2014.[8] On December 28, 2014, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Swift's former record label Big Machine held an impromptu Q&A via Twitter. When asked by a fan about 1989's upcoming single following "Shake It Off" and "Blank Space", Borchetta responded that he was in favor of "Style".[9] On February 9, 2015, Republic Records, in partnership with Big Machine, serviced the track to US hot adult contemporary radio as the third single.[10] The following day, Republic serviced "Style" to US contemporary hit and rhythmic contemporary radio.[11][12] The song was released to Italy's contemporary hit radio on April 3, 2015.[13]

"Style" is primarily a synth-pop song.[14][15] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard characterized "Style" as a pop rock song,[9] while the Los Angeles Times's Mikael Wood and The Observer's Kitty Empire described the track's style as "funk-pop".[16][17] The refrain's first half is built on D and G major chords that create a relatively radiant atmosphere. The second half incorporates a B minor chord that evokes a glimpse of sorrow.[18] Like the rest of 1989, the track uses heavy synthesizers, vocal reverberation and features an upbeat production, a dramatic change from Swift's trademark country styles.[19][20][21] Time's Sam Lansky wrote that "Style" has a 1970s disco-tinged groove.[22] The refrain is accompanied by pulsating keyboards underneath.[23] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian compared the song's electronic-oriented styles to those on the soundtrack of the 2011 film Drive and Daft Punk's 2013 album Random Access Memories.[24]

The song's lyrics are ambiguous.[25] Several critics initially thought the song talked about romance and beauty standards in a flirtatious manner.[17][22] Wood pointed out the opening lines "Midnight / You come and pick me up, no headlights" as an allusion to having sex, a subject about which Swift had not previously written.[16] The lyrics, "You've got that James Dean daydream look in your eye / And I've got that red lip classic thing that you like" in the refrain refer to the 1950s actor James Dean and, in the words of The Atlantic's Spencer Kornhaber, reflect conventional beauty standards employed by iconic American figures like Marilyn Monroe and Cindy Crawford.[26] Kornhaber remarked that the "classic" beauty in the lyrics are embedded with racial undertones,[26] and Consequence of Sound's Sasha Geffen explicitly said it mostly applies to white people.[27]

Slate's Forrest Wickman noticed that the song seems to be about "timeless fashions" but actually portrays an unhealthy relationship.[28] During an iHeartRadio live concert on October 27, 2014, Swift said the song's inspiration was a relationship that reminisced "fashion staples that ... we never throw out of our closet".[29] Four days later, during a radio interview with host Ryan Seacrest, she explained that "Style" was inspired by one of her romantic affairs that was "always a bit off", and represented her evolved viewpoints on past relationships by admitting wrongdoings of both sides instead of her "I was right, you were wrong" mindset in previous songs.[7] The lines that suggest Swift's self-asserted maturity are in the second pre-chorus, where she confesses to her unfaithful lover that she too has cheated.[6][18][30]

I say, "I heard that you've been out and about with some other girl"
He says, "What you've heard is true, but I,
Can't stop thinking about you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"
